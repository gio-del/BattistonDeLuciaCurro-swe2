\section{Formal Analysis Using Alloy}
Alloy is a specification language for describing, designing, and verifying the behavior of complex systems.
The language is based on first-order logic, and has a mathematical foundation that allows for automated reasoning
about the correctness of designs.
\subsection{Objectives of the analysis}
The main goal of the formal analysis is to formally describe the domain and properties of the system to be.
This goal is reachable modelling and formally representing the following entities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item actors of the system to be;
    \item reservations
    \item status of a reservation;
\end{itemize}
