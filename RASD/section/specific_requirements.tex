\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
In this section are described details about user interfaces, hardware and application programming interfaces.

    }
    % following mockups
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
To use the system, both EV drivers and CPOs must use a mobile device or a personal computer.
Due to the outdoor expected use of the system, a smartphone will be more suitable device
for a EV driver, instead for a CPO is suggested to use the system from a personal computer.


\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
The system should relies on various external services accessible via uniform web API. These services are:


\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
The system requires a stable internet connection to work properly.
The backend of the system will expose a unified REST compliant API to communicate
with all clients (both CPOs and EV drivers) using HTTPS and TCP/IP.
\\Furthermore, the system relies on various external accessible via uniform web API. These services are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Map Service}: eMall system relies on a map service to get the map and to do operations on the map which is the central component of the application.
    \item \textbf{GPS Service}: eMall system relies on GPS to obtain the location of the user and to show their position on the map
    \item \textbf{DSO Energy Pricing Service}: eMall system use this interface to obtain updated prices of the different DSOs available for the location of the EVCPs. The interface also, permits to select from which DSO acquire energy.
    \item \textbf{EV Service}: eMall system uses this interface that has a register that contains data about all the EVs around the world as the model, the manufacturer, the battery capacity, the efficiency, the range, the connector type and the maximum input power. It is also used to show the battery status of the user's car
    \item \textbf{EVCP Energy Storage System Managing Service}: This interface is used to retrieve data about the energy store system status and the solar panel production and decide how to mix the sources of energy
    \item \textbf{OCPP compliant CP client}: eMall system relies on it to retrieve data or send data to the CPs
    \item \textbf{Calendar OS API}: The interface is used to identify which are the commitments and which are the free slots and suggest proactively when is more convenient to charge
    \item \textbf{Payment Gateway}: eMall system relies on it for processing every payment operation on the application
    \item \textbf{Push Notification Service}: eMall notifications will be sent to update in real time the EV driver that the charging shift will begin shortly, when the charging process has ended and of special offer in nearby CPs
    \item \textbf{SMS Service}: eMall system relies on it to send verification code SMS to customers phones.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
The requirements of the system are not critical, so these performance requirements
are focus on guarantee the best of possible experience to both EV drivers and CPOs.
To do that, the system should provide:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a scalable, reactive and load-balancing backend
    \item the visualization of the map in 5 seconds, or less;
    \item the list of active and historical reservations in less than 5 seconds;
    \item the booking confirmation in 7 seconds, or less;
    \item the loading of the available time slots for a specific charging point in less than 5 seconds;
    \item push app notification with a delay that is imperceptible to the user.
    \item Notice that a good internet connection is assumed in the previous estimations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Constraints}


\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
Specifications described in this document must be respected by the system.
Source code of the application must be commented on and documented adequately.
The system should respect the line guides described by the European GDPR.

\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
The system requires any device and a stable internet connection.

\subsection{Software System Attributes}

\subsubsection{Availability and Reliability}
The system should offer its functionalities with an availability
equal to 99.5, or more. In other words, the system must be inaccessible
for less than two days every year. To achieve this goal, the system should
provide a high redundancy for the most critical components.
Furthermore, in order to guarantee better reliability performances, all
the scheduled maintenance on the system should be done during
the night.
It should also be noted that some functionality of the system relies on external APIs, though the system should not completely fail
because of failure in one of those.

\subsubsection{Security}
The connection between the application and the server must be safe.
System use the TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol.
To do that for this purpose, it is needed an SSL/TSL certificate.
Moreover, all passwords must be encrypted

\subsubsection{Maintainability}
Source code and correlated documentation must be commented and kept updated.
Modularity, low coupling and high cohesion between components must be a focus during the
designing and developing phases.

\subsubsection{Portability}
The system is a web application so it will be supported by any device with
a modern browser.
