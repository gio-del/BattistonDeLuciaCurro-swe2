\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
To use the system, both EV drivers and CPOs must have a mobile device or a personal computer.
Due to the outdoor expected use of the system, a smartphone will be a more suitable device
for a EV driver, instead for a CPO is suggested to use the system from a personal computer.
The system is based on the ability of gathering data from different sources, such as the CP, the battery storage that may be present in an EVCP and the battery status of an EV. These data are provided through hardware interfaces that are external
to our system, and we assume that an API let the system access to these data

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
eMall is a web application, then a modern web browsers is the only software required

\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
The system requires a stable internet connection to work properly.
The backend of the system will expose a unified RESTful API to communicate
with all clients using HTTPS and TCP/IP.
\\Furthermore, the system relies on various external interfaces accessible via uniform web API. These services are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Map Service}: eMall system relies on a map service to get the map and to do operations on the map which is the central component of the application.
    \item \textbf{GPS Service}: eMall system relies on GPS to obtain the location of the user and to show their position on the map
    \item \textbf{DSO Energy Pricing Service}: eMall system use this interface to obtain updated prices of the different DSOs available for the location of the EVCPs. The interface also, permits to select from which DSO acquire energy.
    \item \textbf{EV Service}: eMall system uses this interface that has a register that contains data about all the EVs around the world as the model, the manufacturer, the battery capacity, the efficiency, the range, the connector type and the maximum input power. It is also used to show the battery status of the user's car
    \item \textbf{OCPP compliant CP client}: eMall system relies on it to retrieve data or send data to the CPs
    \item \textbf{Calendar OS API}: The interface is used to identify which are the commitments and which are the free slots and suggest proactively when is more convenient to charge
    \item \textbf{Payment Gateway}: eMall system relies on it for processing every payment operation on the application
    \item \textbf{Push Notification Service}: eMall notifications will be sent to update in real time the EV driver that the charging shift will begin shortly, when the charging process has ended and of special offer in nearby CPs
    \item \textbf{SMS Service}: eMall system relies on it to send verification code SMS to customers phones.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
To guarantee the best possible experience to both EV drivers and CPOs, the system should:
\begin{itemize}
    \item provide a scalable, reactive and capable of load-balancing backend
    \item assure protection against DDoS attacks
    \item provide a responsive and fluid frontend. The frontend must handle correctly asynchronous interactions
          with the server, even when the connection quality is bad, in order to provide the best possible experience
    \item push notification with a delay that is imperceptible to the user
    \item be able to handle a number of users that increases with the growth of the EV market, starting from a base of 10,000 concurrent users
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Constraints}


\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
Specifications described in this document must be respected by the system.
Source code of the application must be commented on and documented adequately.
The system should respect the guidelines described by the GDPR.

\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
The system requires any device and a stable internet connection.

\subsection{Software System Attributes}
\subsubsection{Reliability}
In order to guarantee better reliability performances, all
the scheduled maintenance of the system should be done during
the night.
It should also be noted that some functionality of the system relies on external APIs, though the system should not completely fail
because of failure in one of those. It's also important to avoid data loss through redundant storage methods.

\subsubsection{Availability}
The system should offer its functionalities with an availability
equal to 99.5\%, or more. In other words, the system must be inaccessible
for less than two days every year. To achieve this goal, the system should
provide a high redundancy for the most critical components.


\subsubsection{Security}
To protect users sensible data the system must collect the minimum data possible, and store them in an encrypted database.
The connection between the application must follows modern standard protocols as HTTPS. Do note that not only phone number and password should be considered as sensible data, but also users location, EV details and reservations.
Moreover, all passwords must be salted and encrypted.

\subsubsection{Maintainability}
Source code and correlated documentation must be commented and kept updated.
Modularity, low coupling and high cohesion between components must be a focus during the
designing and developing phases. In particular modularity of the frontend and backend must allow developers to update the backend without users even noticing it.

\subsubsection{Portability}
The application must be available on major mobile OSs targeting at least the current
release. The web application must run at least on the most recent
browsers. It would be a smart choice to reuse most of the codebase
across mobile and web by using cross platform tools.
