\section{Overall Description}

\subsection{Product perspective}

\subsubsection{Registration}
Einar is a driver of an electric vehicle that uses every day to go to his office. He decided to download the eMall app because he heard by a friend of him that he can discover all the charging points in the entire world, booking one, starting a charge and pay for the charge, entirely through the app. After having downloaded it, launches the app for the first time and select sign in button to register into the system. He provides all the personal data required to access in the system and accept to personalise his experience by selecting his car from a provided list of all the EVs. He submits his data and the system asks him to verify his account through email or phone number.
\subsubsection{Book a charge}
Edvar wants to plan a charge for the next days and uses the app to find and book a carghing station nearby his office. In the home of the app he selected the book button and fills the information about the date and the time slot available for him to charge and indicates the zone in the map to scan for available charging stations. After submitting the form, the home page will change according to his information and displays a map of the selected zone with the available charging stations to book. 

Each charging station, if selected, shows the information about the charging point operator, the types of connectors, the availability of them for the filtered period, the charging power at which the connector operates and the cost for recharging 1 kWh. Edvar selected the charging station with the fastest connector but with the lowest price. To book the charge he selected one connector that is available and indicates when he want to start the charge and when to finish. The app, because Edvar accepted to insert his EV model, knows how much time is needed to charge his car so suggested the optimal time to book for a charge (from 10% to 80% of charge). He can accept the suggested book range or override the suggestion and modify the range at his willing inside the availabilty of the connector.
