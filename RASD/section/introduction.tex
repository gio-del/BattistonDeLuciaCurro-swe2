\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
\subsection{Purpose}
The following document is the RASD for the eMall - e-Mobility for All system. It provides
a description of the system focusing on the requirements and specifications, developing scenarios and use cases
to specify what the system must do, how it will interact with the stakeholders and the constraints it is subject to.

\subsection{Scope}
With the higher focus on the impact of our urban and suburban travel on the environment and the higher accessibility of electric mobility, an increase of circulating electric vehicles can be observed.
\footnote{\url{https://www.eea.europa.eu/ims/new-registrations-of-electric-vehicles}} \footnote{\url{https://www.statista.com/statistics/1101415/number-of-electric-vehicles-by-type/}} \footnote{\href{https://www.eib.org/en/surveys/climate-survey/4th-climate-survey/hybrid-electric-petrol-cars-flying-holidays-climate.htm}{European Investment Bank Climate Survey}}
This increase concerns both private vehicles and goods transporting ones.
As a result of restrictions on fuel vehicle production and sell that will concern a large part of the world's population\footnote{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out\_of\_fossil\_fuel\_vehicles\#Places\_with\_planned\_fossil-fuel\_vehicle\_restrictions}{Places with planned fossil-fuel vehicle restrictions}}, the number of
electric vehicle is still set to increase. For these reasons, the main vehicle manufacturers have started making huge investments in electric mobility\footnote{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric\_car\#EV\_plans\_from\_major\_manufacturers}{EV plans from major manufacturers}}, which will lead to greater accessibility to the market by drivers.\\
A main problem of electric vehicles is that a full charge requires much more time than a fuel vehicle refuel.
\footnote{\href{https://blinkcharging.com/fact-from-fiction-the-real-reason-why-consumers-dont-buy-electric-vehicles/?locale=en}{Why consumers don't buy electric vehicles}}
Thus, a single charge can have a huge impact on our daily schedule, and it is necessary to plan wisely when and where to charge.
Furthermore, some electric vehicle owners don't have the proper equipment to recharge at home, or their vehicle discharges in the middle of the road and the driver doesn't have the possibility to go home to recharge.\\
To solve these problems is one of the main objective of the eMall - e-Mobility for All system.\\
This system aims to develop an efficient planning of the charging process of electric vehicles that limits the carbon footprint caused by people mobility needs.\\\\
The main actor in this system are the drivers and the CPOs - Charging Point Operators, who manage their charging columns, along with the DSOs - Distribution System Operator, in charge of distributing the energy.
The digital system eMall should provide three main features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Booking} allows EV owners to book a charge. The remote booking avoids interference
          in the daily schedule of the owners, and it includes a notification
          system that alerts owners when their reservation is going to start.
    \item \textbf{Charging} allows EV owners to charge an EV, remotely monitor their charging
          process and be notified at the end of the charge.
          Thanks to these features, owners have not anymore the need to
          physically go to the CP when they want to retrieve details of their charge.
    \item  \textbf{Managing an EVCP} allows CPOs to get statistics on live and historical details
          about their EVCP - Electric Vehicle Charging Pool, to acquire information about the current energy price by
          DSOs and to decide in an automated way where to get energy for charging.
\end{itemize}
