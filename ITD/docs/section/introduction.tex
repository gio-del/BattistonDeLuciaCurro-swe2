\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
This document outlines the implementation and testing procedures that have been followed to develop a functioning prototype of the service described in the "Requirements Analysis and Specification Document" and "Design Document".
It is intended to serve as a reference for the development team, detailing the software, frameworks, and programming languages chosen.
