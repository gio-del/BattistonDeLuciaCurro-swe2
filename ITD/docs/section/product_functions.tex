\section{Product functions}
In this section, we present the implemented and discarded functional requirements of the prototype.

\subsection{CPO functions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item        \textbf{R1}  The system must allow unregistered CPO to register an account                                                                                            \\
          \textbf{Implemented:} Yes, in the form of a registration page
    \item        \textbf{R2}  The system must allow registered CPO to login                                                                                                            \\
          \textbf{Implemented:} Yes, in the form of a login page
    \item        \textbf{R3}  The system must allow authenticated CPOs making a special offer on their CPs prices                                                                      \\

    \item        \textbf{R4}  The system must allow authenticated CPOs monitoring the charging process to infer when the battery is full                                               \\
          \textbf{Implemented:} No, it is not possible to monitor the charging process. Although we have implemented a simple socket simulator, it is not possible because it would need sensors to monitor the charging process
    \item        \textbf{R5}  The system must allow authenticated CPOs retrieving the amount of energy available in their EVCPs batteries                                              \\

    \item        \textbf{R6}  The system must allow authenticated CPOs retrieving the number of vehicle being charged in their EVCPs and for each vehicle the amount of absorbed power \\
          \textbf{Implemented:} +/-, it is possible to retrieve the number of vehicle being charged in their EVCPs but for the same reasons as R4, it is not possible to retrieve the amount of energy being absorbed

          \textbf{Implemented:} +/-, it is possible to retrieve the end of a reservation but not an estimation of the remaining charge time, for the same reasons as R4
    \item        \textbf{R8}  The system must allow authenticated CPOs retrieving details on active and historical reservations on their EVCPs                                         \\
          \textbf{Implemented:} Yes, in the reservations tab of the CPO dashboard
    \item        \textbf{R9}  The system must allow authenticated CPOs acquiring information from the DSOs about the current price of energy                                           \\

          \textbf{Implemented:} Yes, via a mocked 'DSO API' in the Energy tab of the CPO dashboard
    \item        \textbf{R11} The system must dynamically decide where to get energy for charging (electrical grid, battery or a mixture)                                              \\
          \textbf{Implemented:} No
    \item        \textbf{R12} The system must allow authenticated CPOs statically deciding where to get energy for charging (electrical grid, battery or a mixture)                    \\
          \textbf{Implemented:} +/-, via the Energy API and the battery key it is possible to set an operating mode for the battery
    \item        \textbf{R13} The system must allow authenticated CPOs adding, modifying and deleting CPs                                                                              \\
          \textbf{Implemented:} Yes, in the Charging Points tab of the CPO dashboard it is possible to create EVCP, adding CP to them and then sockets to the CP
    \item        \textbf{R14} The system must allow authenticated CPOs changing availability status of their CPs                                                                       \\
          \textbf{Implemented:} No
