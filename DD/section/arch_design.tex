\section{Architectural Design}
\subsection{Overview}
The figure shown below represents a high-level description of the components which make up the System.
In this document the presentation layer and the Client (e.g. the Browser)
will be referred to as the Frontend, while the Application Layer and the Data Layer
will be referred to as the Backend.

A web interface will be used to access the service. A single page application (SPA) will be developed for drivers and CPOs to use the system. An SPA is a good choice for this type of application because it allows for a lot of interaction without the need for frequent page reloads, which can provide a faster and more seamless user experience. The overall architecture of the system is divided into different layers, with the application servers interacting with a database management system and using APIs to retrieve and store data. The application servers are designed to be stateless according to REST standards, and the system includes firewalls to enhance security.

\paragraph*{eMSP Web App} \hfill \\
The EV drivers' application uses client-side rendering of web pages. When a user sends a request through their browser, the eMSP application server responds by sending back HTML and JavaScript code, which the browser downloads and runs. As the user interacts with the page, the JavaScript can make additional requests to the server and update the page dynamically without requiring a full page reload.

\paragraph*{eMSP Application Server} \hfill \\
The eMSP Application Server is responsible for the business logic to provide the functionality to the application for the EV Drivers and to coordinate the information flow between application layer and data layer
It is composed of several components, each of them used for a specific functionality:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{eMPS's Account Manager} \\ This component handles all the account operations related to the CPO and offers an interface to authenticate
          the requests in the CPMS application server.
          It offers functionality to create new account, logging in, setting preferences and verify the authentication of the user at any time.
          To create a new account interacts with the external SMS API to make the user receive a code to verify the identity.
    \item \textbf{CP Search} \\ This component handles the operations needed to show the CPs in a specified range of km near a location. The location
          can be described as an address, with coordinates or by geolocating the actual position of the incoming request. It selects the filtered CPs that are then
          shown in the map as placeholders.
    \item \textbf{Car Manager} \\ This component handles the operations related to the status of the car. It offers an interface to select the EV model among a list of
          all the marketed models and offers an interface to connect the car to the application. It uses this information to show the battery status of the EV, the
          amount of power during a charging process and to suggest charging plans based on the specific vehicle and status of it.
    \item \textbf{Reservation Manager} \\ This component handles all the operations related to the reservations for the EV Drivers. It offers the possibility to create a reservation
          for a charge and pay for that reservation, see the details of a reservation, start or pause a charge of a particular reservation and see the recap of an already occurred reservation.
          It permits paying for a reservation using an external Payment Gateway that handles all the payment process and returns the status of the payment.

\end{figure}

\paragraph*{CPO Web App} \hfill \\
It represents the application dedicated to the different CPOs using the system. This component contains the logic to receive HTTPS requests from the users' browser,
forward them to the CPMS Application Server, and generate dynamic pages based on the response from the CPMS Application Server.

\paragraph*{CPMS Application Server} \hfill \\
The CPMS Application Server is responsible for the business logic to provide the functionality to the application for the CPOs and to coordinate the information flow between application layer and data layer.
It is composed of several components, each of them used for a specific functionality:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Booking Manager} \\
          This component handles the operations regarding the reservation of a specific CPO. It offers the possibility to manage the reservations and to control their status.
    \item \textbf{Rate Manager} \\ This component is responsible for the operations regarding the rates of that are associated with the CPs. It offers the possibility to
          create a new rate in all its details, to add a special rate and specify the duration. The created rates then are associated to a specific CP.
    \item \textbf{Energy Manager} \\ This component is responsible for the operations regarding the managing of the energy of the different EVCPs.
          It offers the possibility to verify the energy consumption and production of the different sources, modify and visualize the status of the energy storage system,
          visualize the availability of energy contracts provided by the DSOs for a specific EVCP and stipulate a contract among the ones available.
    \item \textbf{Charging Points Manager} \\ This component handles the operations regarding the managing of the CPs. It is an OCPP server for the CPs, offering the
          required functionalities for adding and removing a CP, for starting and stopping a charge and for receiving status data by the CP. It offers an interface to connect the different CPs through their platform.
    \item \textbf{CPMS's Account Manager} \\ This component handles all the account operations related to the CPO and offers an interface to authenticate the requests in the CPMS application server.
          It offers functionality to create new account, logging in, setting preferences and verify the authentication of the user at any time.
          To create a new account interacts with the external SMS API to make the user receive a code to verify the identity.

\subsubsection{Logical Description of Data}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.30]{src/ERDiagram/er_diagram.pdf}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Deployment view}

Our system consists of two parts: a static web server and an application server. The static web server will be the entry point for clients to access the SPA, while the application server will provide the necessary APIs for the SPA to work. We have chosen to use two different solutions for these components. The static web server will be hosted on a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to ensure fast response times through its edge location caches and reverse proxies. The application server, which includes both a business logic layer and a data tier, will be hosted on a cloud provider.
This offers several advantages compared to traditional in-house hosting, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scalability and Flexibility - the ability to add or remove resources such as virtual machines, performance cores, or memory as needed, and the use of load balancing services, allows the application server to adapt to changes in traffic or workload.
    \item Security - services like live monitoring and firewalls help to protect the application server against data breaches, cyberattacks, and other security threats.
    \item Cost-efficiency - the pay-as-you-go model of a cloud provider allows to only pay for the resources that are actually used, which can help to lower the overall costs.
\end{itemize}
These features make a cloud provider an ideal choice for hosting large, high-traffic applications. The chosen cloud provider will need to offer all of these features in order to meet our needs.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{src/deploymentDiagram/deployment_diagram.pdf}
    \caption{EV Driver Registration process}
\end{figure}

The deployment diagram offers a more detailed view over the hardware and software resources of the application:
\begin{itemize}
    \item PC or Mobile Device is any device having a modern browser capable of running the JavaScript based web app.
    \item The SPA will be hosted by a CDN, which will allow it to be downloaded without affecting the performance of the main application server. The SPA is static and all of its code is run on the client's machine, so there is no need for any logic to be implemented on the CDN side.
    \item The Cloud Services will host all the business and data logic for the system. It contains:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \textbf{Firewall} services are used to filter incoming connections to the business and data layers of a system. They provide an additional layer of security by blocking or allowing traffic based on predetermined rules. This helps to protect the system from unauthorized access or malicious attacks.
              \item \textbf{Load balancer} to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of an application in order to optimize resource utilization, improve performance, and ensure high availability. The load balancer helps to ensure that the application can handle a large volume of requests without becoming overloaded or experiencing downtime. It also helps to provide a more stable and reliable experience for users by redirecting traffic to the least busy application instance.
              \item Multiple copies of the \textbf{application}. The various instances can run in parallel and independently to meet the demand for the application. These instances can be created or deleted as needed. Running multiple instances allows the application to handle a high volume of requests without experiencing performance issues, and provides fault tolerance by allowing traffic to be redirected to a different instance if one instance becomes unavailable.
              \item \textbf{Data Instance} which is a data optimized virtual machine containing the DBMS and the database.
          \end{itemize}

\subsection{Runtime view}
The runtime view describe the interactions between actors, subsystems and interfaces of the system showing the specific method called.
The views are divided between eMSP and CPMS.

\subsubsection{eMSP}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{EV Driver Registration} : The following diagram represents the workflow that an EV Driver has to follow to register into eMall.\\
          \\When the unregistered user enters the input data the System will check whether the data input is valid. If the input is valid,
          the request is forwarded to the Account Manager that proceeds to evaluate if there is another user registered with
          the same phone number. If the user has inserted a phone number not already registered, then the user is created and an sms verification
          code is sent to the user through the SMS Service. After receiving the correct verification code the user is notified that the
          registration is completed.

    \item \textbf{EV Driver books a charge} : The following diagram represents the workflow when the EV Driver books a charge.\\
          \\After the submission of the reservation parameters by the user, the Reservation Manager interacts with the eMSPtoCPMSConnector to
          contact the specific CPMS to book the charge. The reservations parameters are received by the specific CPMStoeMSPConnector that
          forwards the payload to the Booking Manager that contacts the Query Manager to verify that the reservations parameters aren't in
          conflict with others reservations. If the reservation is valid then is added to the database through the Query Manager and the Reservation
          Manager of the eMSP is notified of the validity of the reservation. The Reservation Manager contacts the Payment Gateway to pre-authorize the
          payment with the credit card that has been already added and selected by the EV Driver.

          The Reservation manager interacts with the eMSPtoCPMSConnector to contact the specific CPMS. Through the CPMStoeMSPConnector the
          Booking Manager receives the request to start a charge. Verifies through the Query Manager that the request corresponds to a reservation
          that can be started. If so, the Booking Manager contacts the Charging Points Manager to activate the socket of the CP specified in the reservation.
          The Charging Points Manager contacts the CP through the OCPP Compliant CP interface and starts the charge.

          \\After the discharge of the car, the interface EV Service sends "lowBatteryEvent".
          The Suggestion Manager receives carID such that can obtain through the Query Manager, from the DB, the corresponding userID.
          The Suggestion Manager, thanks to the attribute calendar "key" of the user, interacts with the Calendar API and receives "FreeSpots" (those
          time intervals in the user Calendar that are free).
          The Suggestion Manager contacts the Query Manager with "getTopKSuggestions" through which obtains the top K suggestions according
          to the ranking algorithm implemented by the system.
          The Suggestion Manager contacts Notification Manager through which contacts the Query Manager to find the notification preferences.

    We decided to use a three-layer, four-tier architecture for our software system because it offers several benefits. First, it allows us to divide the system into distinct layers (presentation, business logic, data access) and tiers (client, static web server, application server, DBMS), which makes the system more modular and easier to modify or maintain. It also enables us to reuse code and components across different layers and tiers. Additionally, the separation of the layers and tiers allows us to scale the system more easily by distributing the workload across multiple servers. Finally, the architecture enables the use of load balancing and caching techniques to improve performance.
    \item \textbf{RESTful APIs}\\
    We chose to use a REST API as the backend for the frontend application because it offers several benefits. The API is based on standard web technologies, making it easy to consume and integrate with other systems. It is stateless, which simplifies the development. Additionally, the REST API is scalable, which can improve the overall performance of the system.
    \item \textbf{Adapter Pattern}\\
    The Query Manager component acts as an adapter between the business logic and the DBMS services. It provides a simplified interface for accessing the DBMS, while hiding the underlying complexity and exposing only a limited set of high-level functions.

\subsection{Other design decisions}
\subsubsection{PWA}
The decision to build the web application as a PWA for drivers was made in order to improve the offline functionality, performance, and app-like experience of the application, as well as making it easier to install. This design choice enables the web application to work offline or with a low-quality network connection, using service workers to store assets and data locally. The PWA also improves performance by reducing the need for network requests and loading faster due to the use of service workers. Finally, the PWA can be easily installed on the user's device, similar to a native mobile app, making it convenient for drivers to access the application.
\subsubsection{Scale-out}
The decision to implement a scale out design in the software was taken to enhance its ability to scale, its availability, and its performance. This design approach enables the system to expand its capacity to cope with increased demand by adding more resources, such as servers or machines, as needed. This can be more cost-effective than upgrading individual components and avoids the need for downtime. The scale out design also improves the system's reliability by providing redundant resources that can take over if any component fails. In addition, the design allows for flexibility, as resources can be added or removed as required. Lastly, the scale out design improves the system's performance by allowing workloads to be processed in parallel rather than sequentially.

\subsubsection{Relational Database}
We selected a relational database for our system design because it is effective at storing structured data, enforcing data integrity, and providing fast query performance. It can also scale to handle large amounts of data and support many concurrent users. The database allows us to store and retrieve information efficiently, while also ensuring that the data is accurate and consistent.
\subsubsection{The separation of eMSP and CPMSs}
The decision to design eMSP and CPMSs as independent entities is driven by the need to maintain a consistent interface between them that follows a standard protocol. While this may initially lead to the duplication of some common components, it is necessary because the systems have distinct roles. As the operating environment is subject to change, it is possible that future standard protocols will require eMSP and CPMS to follow a single protocol for searching and booking CPs. By designing them as independent entities, it will be easier to incorporate any new protocol and enable eMSP to access CPMSs even from CPOs not directly subscribed to the system.
