\section{User Interface Design}
In the RASD, mockups for both the CPO and driver web app have already been created. We have included UX flowcharts in this document because they are useful for visualizing the user experience and providing a clear overview of the interactions and steps involved in using the web app. They help to ensure that the web app is easy to use and intuitive for users.
